# Supporting tools for Agile software development: experience from a real use case

This repository contains the source code and the final version of my Bacherlor thesis in Computer Science at the Università degli Studi di Padova.

## Abstract

This document describes the work done during the internship period by Athonet S.R.L. between the months of June and July of 2019.
Athonet presented its needs to have a suite of software that would allow them to have a more disciplined way of working.
The objective was to create a suitable environment using the tools Jira and Confluence, developed by Atlassian, ready to be transferred into production.
These software have been developed to work alongside: an Issue Tracking System to always keep track of the project’s progress and a sharing platform that allows a better control over project related documents.
With their features a company could also create a portal to communicate with clients and have documentation of their products public, in order for the customers to have access it anytime.
By introducing Jira and Confluence in its way of working, a company can adopt Agile methodologies or similar ones which would allow not only a better project management but a better handling of the resources as well.
