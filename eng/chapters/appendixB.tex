\chapter{Appendix B: Project requirements}
\label{AppendixB}

\section{Notation}
	Requirements in this text are referenced as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{O} (\Quote{Obbligatorio} in italian) for Mandatory: that have to be implemented, represent the core of the project
		\item \textit{D} (Desiderabile in italian) for Desirable: not mandatory for the final objective but add greater value
		\item \textit{F} (Facoltativi in italian) for Optional: add value to the project but not as much as the previous ones, carried out only if there is time left for them
	\end{itemize}
	Each requirement has a unique ID that is composed by the first letter of their importance (from the Italian word to resemble the \Quote{Piano di Lavoro}) and an increasing number.
